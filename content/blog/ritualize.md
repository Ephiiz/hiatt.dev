Ritualize is an application written in Rust which I created to help with my research into classical Greco-Roman mythology and religous practices. It allows the user to create a single-source-of-truth knowledge base during research, and then allows for advanced searching through that information for creation of new entries so the researcher can find connections or previous entries easily and in ways they may not have been able to previously.
